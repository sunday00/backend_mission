# laravel-faker-provider-collection

This package contains a [Service Provider](https://laravel.com/docs/5.7/providers) that automatically registers the [faker-provider-collection](https://github.com/mbezhanov/faker-provider-collection) library with your [Laravel](https://laravel.com/) application.

Detailed information about the various Faker providers exposed by [faker-provider-collection](https://github.com/mbezhanov/faker-provider-collection) can be found [here](https://github.com/mbezhanov/faker-provider-collection/blob/master/README.md).

## Quickstart

Add the provider to your Laravel project via [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/):

```bash
composer require --dev mbezhanov/laravel-faker-provider-collection
```

You should now be able to use the all the extra providers bundled with this library in your [Model Factories](https://laravel.com/docs/5.7/seeding#using-model-factories)

In example, assuming you have defined the following model factory:

```php
<?php

// ./database/factories/StudentFactory.php

use Faker\Generator as Faker;

$factory->define(App\Models\Student::class, function (Faker $faker) {
    return [
        'university' => $faker->university,
        'sport' => $faker->sport,
        'team' => $faker->team,
    ];
});
```

You should be able to do:

```bash
/app # php artisan tinker
